## Abstract
Mapping probabilistic scenarios and actors to games is generally a qualitative measure, reducing the accuracy of games. Due to the unknown in between quantum theories and the real world, quantum games are too presumptive, filling the wide unknown with assumptions. The advantage of quantum approaches, which incorporate probabilism just like real scenarios, does not make a difference for that. However, even though quantum approaches like the quantum field theory do not offer realistic and valuable game frameworks, their agency can be transferred qualitatively if applied to a comparative approach. Instead of using probabilistic quantum approaches just within games, a quantized approach can already be applied during the mapping process, shaping the game instead of being the game. The mapping process is qualitative in any case. Probabilistic agencies are comparable, without blurring quantitative impacts in between. This approach preserves original probabilistic characteristics and records comprehensibly mapping mutations throughout the process.
