# Political science and games  
Drafts and finals of workingpapers about political science and game theory  
  
## General  
Each paper is in a separate folder, containing a PDF file with the full paper and a README.me with an abstract. Maybe, I will upload raw files with the full text to enable edit/blame/compare/merge within git. Anyway, if raw/docx is needed, let me know.
